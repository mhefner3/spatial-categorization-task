Behavioral task code for a spatial + categorization experiment (jsPsych + JATOS)

# Spatial Categorization Behavioral Task

This repository contains the behavioral task code for a spatial categorization experiment implemented in **jsPsych** and deployed via **JATOS**.

The experiment was developed iteratively across multiple versions. This repository includes **only the versions reported in the manuscript**, preserved in their original form for transparency and reproducibility.

## Repository Structure

```
paper_versions/
├── v4/
├── v6/
├── v10/
└── v11/
```


Each version directory is a **self-contained JATOS study**, including:
- HTML entry file
- JavaScript task logic
- `stimuli/` directory
- `jspsych/` library directory

Versions are intentionally kept separate to reflect differences in task structure, design, and experimental logic.

## Versions Included in the Paper

- **v4** (experiment 1) — Introduction of keypress responses and spatial congruency manipulation  
- **v6** (experiment 2) — Within-subject design with multiple task phases  
- **v10** (experiment 3) — Balanced multi-phase design reinstating congruency-confounded responses  
- **v11** (experiment 4) — Final refined version with completely split training and testing used as the primary reference implementation  

Unless otherwise noted, analyses in the manuscript were conducted using these versions.

## Recommended Version

**Version 11 (`v11`)** is the recommended reference implementation for reuse or adaptation.

---

## Running the Task (JATOS)

Each version can be run independently:

1. Install JATOS locally: https://www.jatos.org
2. Create a new study in JATOS
3. Upload the contents of a version folder (e.g., `paper_versions/v11/`)
4. Open the study link generated by JATOS to launch the task

No additional build steps are required.

## Notes

- Earlier pilot versions are not included, as they are not analyzed in the manuscript.
- File paths and structure have been preserved exactly as used during data collection.
- This repository is intended for transparency and reproducibility rather than active development.
