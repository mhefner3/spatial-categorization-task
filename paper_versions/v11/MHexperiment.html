    <!-- Information Sheet -->
    <div class="mainContent" id="information-sheet" style="display:block;">
            <h2>Information for participants</h2>

            <p>Thank you for being willing to participate in our experiment. Your contribution to our research is very valuable and we appreciate your help.</p>

            <h3>Background and aims of the study </h3>

            <p>Understanding how humans make decisions is a key concern in the social, behavioural and neural sciences. By exploring how humans make decisions, researchers have an opportunity to understand a range of human behaviours, such as consumer activities, voting patterns, and social interactions. Studying decisions can also provide an understanding of the basic information processing mechanisms that underlie healthy cognition and, by extension, how they are impaired in clinical disorders. Our project is geared at studying the basic information processing steps that occur when humans make judgments about sensory stimuli (visual or auditory), or how they choose among stimuli with differing economic worth. Of particular interest, we want to understand the mechanisms by which humans “commit” to a choice, how they decide when to make such a commitment, and to chart the contextual variables that influence the decisions that humans make, including factors relating to attention, memory, and motivation.</p>

            <h3>Why have I been invited to take part?</h3>

            <p>You have freely elected to participate in the study after viewing its availability on Prolific. Only participants over 18 years old are eligible to take part in this study.</p>

            <h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>

            <p>No. If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself and all data associated with your participation from the study at any time, without giving reason and without penalty, by simply exiting the task.</p>

            <h3>What will happen in the study?</h3>

            <p>If you are happy to take part in the study, you will perform computerised tasks that involve the presentation of visual stimuli (on the computer screen) or auditory stimuli. During the task you are requested to press buttons or move a mouse cursor to make decisions about these stimuli. Typically, our tasks involve judgments about categories (e.g. is this bar tilted clockwise or counterclockwise of the vertical line?), estimation judgments (e.g. what is the average height of rectangles on the screen?), or judgments of preference (e.g. which of two economic goods do you prefer?). Occasionally we may ask you to rate your confidence (“Are you sure you were correct?”).</p>

            <p>In most tasks you will receive feedback about your choice, for example by a showing the words “correct” or “incorrect” on the screen. Whether or not you will receive feedback will be clearly before you take part in the study.</p>

            <p>The study should take around 75 minutes, although if you take long breaks during the study, it may take longer. You will be reimbursed for your participation at an hourly rate.</p>

            <h3>Are there any potential risks in taking part?</h3>

            <p>There are no risks other than those posed by everyday life. You are free to withdraw at any time.</p>

            <h3>Are there any benefits in taking part?</h3>

            <p>There will be no direct benefit to you from taking part in this research. However, your participation may benefit our understanding of how humans make decisions, which could inform better treatments for psychological disorders like addictive behaviour.</p>

            <h3>What happens to the data provided? </h3>

            <p>The research data (button presses or mouse movements, and details of your reported age and gender) will be stored confidentially on the researcher's computers. The researchers in this study have no access to personal information about you, or to other information (e.g. your browsing history).</p>

            <p>Research data will be stored confidentially in password-protected documents, on designated computers. Only the research team and authorized personnel will have access to research data. All research data and records will be stored for a minimum retention period of 3 years after publication or public release of the work of the research.</p>

            <h3>Will the research be published?</h3>

            <p>The research may be published in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. We make every effort to make our publications open-access, but this is not always possible and depends on the journal's publication policy.</p>

            <p>In addition, the research may be written up as part of a student thesis. On successful submission of the thesis, it will be deposited both in print and online in the University archives, to facilitate its use in future research. The thesis will be published open access.</p>

            <p>The University of Oxford is committed to the dissemination of its research for the benefit of society and the economy and, in support of this commitment, has established an online archive of research materials. This archive includes digital copies of student theses successfully submitted as part of a University of Oxford postgraduate degree programme. Holding the archive online gives easy access for researchers to the full text of freely available theses, thereby increasing the likely impact and use of that research.</p>

            <h3>Who has reviewed this study?</h3>

            <p>This study has been reviewed by, and received ethics clearance through, the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee (reference number: R50750/RE001).</p>

            <h3>Who do I contact if I have a concern about the study or I wish to complain?</h3>

    <!-- Main Experiment -->
    <div id="welcomeScreen" style="position: none; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background: white; color: black; display: none; justify-content: center; align-items: center; z-index: 1000;">
        <div style="text-align: center; padding: 20px 60px;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px; margin-bottom: 50px;">Welcome to the experiment!</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 23px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Please read the instructions carefully:</p>
            <p style="font-size: 23px;">This experiment aims to study learning of abstract objects. It will last approximately 75 minutes.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 23px;">You will perform two main tasks: a spatial object learning and an object categorization. You will perform each set of tasks four times, using a different set of objects each time. You will begin with all 4 sets of spatial tasks, then given a quick reminder of each set of objects before each of the categorization tasks.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 23px;">In the object learning section, your task is to learn which objects fall into which grid squares by dragging images with the computer mouse to their correct grid square.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 23px;">You will receive feedback after each trial. If the location is correct, a green square will surround the object. If not, a red square will surround it, followed by the object appearing at its correct position, surrounded in green.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 23px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: red;">You have 10 seconds to respond to each object. If you do not respond in time, you'll receive a warning and be skipped to the next trial.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 23px;">You will have a quick rest period every 32 learning trials (one block). Please limit rest breaks to a couple minutes at most. After each block, you'll receive an accuracy score to know how your performance is going.</p>
            <button id="begin-experiment-btn" style="padding: 15px 30px; font-size: 24px; background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 8px; cursor: pointer; margin-top: 20px;">Begin Experiment</button>

    <div id="reminderScreen" style="position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background: white; color: black; display: none; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; text-align: center; font-size: 25px; z-index: 1000;">
        <div style="text-align: center; padding: 20px 60px; margin-top: 100px;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px; margin-bottom: 50px;">Reminder</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Remember, the overall experiment lasts around 75 minutes.<br>
                Please make sure to have an environment free of distractions during this entire time interval, and limit breaks to a couple of minutes at most.
            </p>            
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                For efficient data collection, it is important that you aim to do the whole experiment in a single stretch. This means avoiding the 10 second time-out while responding to the objects and using only the breaks in between blocks to rest.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">
                Please remember to respond as accurately and quickly as you possibly can during the entire session.

            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 20px;">We will now proceed with the spatial learning tasks. You will receive instructions for each section before you begin.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 25px;">In each trial an object will appear at the center of the screen. Click and drag the object with the computer mouse to its correct grid square.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Only one square is correct. If the location is correct, a green square will surround the object. If not, a red square will surround it, followed by the object appearing at its correct position, surrounded in green.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">You will see the same object multiple times in each block. Do your best to remember which location it belongs to.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: red;">You have 10 seconds to respond to each object. If you do not respond in time, you'll receive a warning and be skipped to the next trial.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Respond as accurately and quickly as possible. You will receive a summary of your accuracy at the end of each block.</p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 48px;">Spatial Refresher</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">We will now go through a very quick refresher of one of the spatial tasks you saw previously, before continuing on to the following task.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">In each trial an object will appear at the center of the screen. Click and drag the object with the computer mouse to its correct grid square.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Only one square is correct. If the location is correct, a green square will surround the object. If not, a red square will surround it, followed by the object appearing at its correct position, surrounded in green.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">You will see each object only once this time. Do your best to remember which location it belongs to.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: red;">You have 10 seconds to respond to each object. If you do not respond in time, you'll receive a warning and be skipped to the next trial.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Respond as accurately and quickly as possible. You will receive a summary of your accuracy at the end of each block.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 25px;">The objects seen in each set of the spatial tasks belong to two different categories. Your task now is to learn these associations. You will see each set in the same order you saw them in the spatial tasks.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">In each trial an object will appear at the center of the screen. Place your index fingers on the 'A' and 'L' keys. Use your fingers to press the assigned keys for each category.</p>
            <p id="key-mapping-text" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold; color: blue;"></p> <!-- This displays key mappings -->
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Only one category is correct. If the category is correct, a green square will surround the object. If not, a red square will surround it.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">You will see the same object multiple times in each block. Do your best to remember which category it belongs to.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: red;">You have 10 seconds to respond to each object. If you do not respond in time, you'll receive a warning and be skipped to the next trial.</p>
